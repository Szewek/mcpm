# mcpm â€“ Minecraft Package Manager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Szewek/mcpm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Szewek/mcpm)

`mcpm` is a package manager that lets you manage mods, saves and resource packs. It's written in Go.

This repository IS NOT related to [mcpm/mcpm](https://github.com/mcpm/mcpm).

## How does this work?
`mcpm` uses Curse CDN to gather information about everything Minecraft-related. So everything downloadable in Curse is also available in `mcpm`.

Package name comes from its curse.com URL. For example: /mc-mods/minecraft/**`tinkers-construct`**

## Installation

Check [Releases](https://github.com/Szewek/mcpm/releases) for downloads

To get the latest build, get [Go](https://golang.org/) and type this command:
```
go get github.com/Szewek/mcpm
```

If you have it compiled, make sure you have set GOPATH/bin in PATH environment variable.

Only in 0.1.0, for first time you have to update database.
```
mcpm update
```

Version 0.2.0 does this automatically.

## Use examples
